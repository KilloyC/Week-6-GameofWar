//GAME OF WAR!!!

/*In this version there are only 2 players.
1. Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards. Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card. 
2. The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point, Ties result in zero points for both Players.
3. After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.
4. Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the functions you write.*/

/*As a part of this assignment, you will also be asked to consider:
-- Creating classes such as Card, Deck & Player
-- Keeping in mind what fields and methods each class might have.*/
